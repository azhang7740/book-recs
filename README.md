# book-recs
Implements matrix factorization to return relevant book recommendations based on Goodreads 10k Dataset (https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k,https://www.kaggle.com/zygmunt/goodbooks-10k). 

The data folder stores data downloaded from the Goodreads book dataset. The books_matrix_factorization notebook illustrates the implementation, and correlation_mat is the generated correlation matrix between book pairs.
